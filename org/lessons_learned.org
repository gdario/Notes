* Perfectionism does not pay back

Scientists want to have answers quickly. It is better to deliver something fast, even if not completely correct, than something impeccable after a long time.

In more than 20 years in this field have never seen a single case where a more sophisticated method made the real difference in a scientific problem.

- More and better data.
- Transformative technologies.

* Increase your visibility

** Present. A lot

In 2020 you have presented way too little. You need to be much more visible.

** Ugly presentations reduce the value of what you present

The idea that results speak for themselves, and that they don't need to be polished, is just wrong. Make presentations beautiful, clear, engaging.

** Presentation skills are crucial

- Find resources on public speaking.
- Read books/watch videos on how to present data.
- Read books/watch videos on how to make engaging presentations.
