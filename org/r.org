* R in Projects

Much of the time spent on projects is actually wasted on technicalities that may be solved with a bit of study. Examples are:

- Tidy evaluation.
- Tidyverse.
  - dplyr
  - tidyr
  - purrr
  - lubridate
  - stringr
  - ...

* Visualization (including animations)

Find one or more galleries of impressive plots and learn how to make them.

* Advanced R

** S3 Classes

*** Chapter on S3 in Advanced R ([[https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html][link]])

Implement some small but instructive classes that solve a real problem.

* Tidyverse

*** Row-wise operations
