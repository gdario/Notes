# TO DO

## XGBoost and multi-class or multi-label classification

Write a notebook showing how to work with XGBoost with multi-class and multi-label data. Particular attention should go into:

- Understanding which metric can be used out of the box from XGBoost (it has some multi-label metrics), and which ones instead should be used in combination with the `XGBClassifier` estimator from `sklearn`.
