# Tidyr

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- tibble(treatment_a = rnorm(5), 
  treatment_b = rnorm(5), 
  names = LETTERS[1:5])
```

## Introduction

### Gathering

Simple gathering can be performed on the above dataset as shown below:

```{r simple_gathering}
df %>% gather(key = treatment, value = glucose, -names)
```

This version, based on NSE, works fine for interactive calculations. The SE equivalent is `gather_`.

```{r gather_}
cols_to_aggregate <- c("treatment_a", "treatment_b")
key_col = "treatment"
val_col = "glucose"
df %>% gather_(key_col, val_col, cols_to_aggregate)
```
