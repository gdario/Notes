# General Questions

## Model Blending

How does it work? Find some good references.

## GaussRank

There is an introduction to GaussRank [here](http://fastml.com/preparing-continuous-features-for-neural-networks-with-rankgauss/). The method was introduced by GrandMaster Michael Jahrer for the Porto Seguro challenge. He actually called it "RankGauss".

## Class Imbalance

Some targets were extremely rare. How did participants deal with this? One very good starting point is [this post](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/191545) by Matthew Masters.

## Cross Validation Schemes

Most people seem to have adopted (variants of) Chris Deotte's CV scheme. What was special about it?

## Chris Deotte's Analysis of the LB Gap

Chris Deotte has run a very interesting analysis to understand the origin of the gap between public and private leaderboard.

## Tips

There is an interesting and highly voted post title "[A list of tips](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/191621)". It contains links to interesting discussions on a number of topics (class imbalance, validation score, seeding, CV strategy).
