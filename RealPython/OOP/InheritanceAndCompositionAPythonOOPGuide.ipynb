    "# Inheritance and Composition: A Python OOP Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create classes that inherit from one another.\n",
    "* Design class hierarchies with UML diagrams.\n",
    "* Use interfaces and abstract classes.\n",
    "* Use multiple inheritance and understand its drawbacks.\n",
    "* Build complex classes with composition.\n",
    "* Change run-time behavior with composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are inheritance and composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are techniques to write better Python code. Both do it by modifying classes so that we can write less code, and make the classes more extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inheritance is about identifying the common attributes and behaviors that exist between objects.\n",
    "* Composition is about identifying how objects are composed of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Large projects have large number of classes. These classes are often related in some way. One class, for example, may be similar to another with some small modifications. Copying and pasting is not a good strategy because if we need to modify something in a class, we have to modify the same thing, with minor variations, in many places, and this is error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance models an **is a** relationship. For example, a cat *is an* animal, an apple *is a* fruit. Fish is both a food and an animal. This relationship is not symmetrical: all cats are animals but not all animals are cats. So, if a cat is an animal, it is a specialized version of an animal, and it inherits all the *attributes* and *behaviors* that are shares among all animals. It may have attributes and behaviors of its own (it is furry and it meows).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some classes that use inheritance. We may have a class `Employee` with attributes `name`, `age`, `id`, `wage` and behaviors `clock_in()`, `work()`, `clock_out()` and `report_info()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add another class, `Waitress`, who is a type of employee. The waitress has all the attributes and behaviors of the `Employee` class, but it also adds some new ones like `shifts`, `tips_totals`, `take_break()` and `work()`. Note that the latter has the same name as the `Employee` class (so she has 5 methods in total), but the implementation is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "![inheritance](fig/inheritance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a new `Cashier` class that inherits from `Employee`. This one only adds a new `customer_served` attribute and modifies the `work()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition models a **has a** or a **part of** relationship. For example, a car *has a* en engine, i.e., the engine is a *part of* the car. We may have a `Car` class with `brand`, `model`, `year` `engine` attributes and `turn_on()`, `accelerate()`, `park()` and `turn_off()` methods. Python does not have a `engine` class, so we must create one, which may, in turn, have the `cylinders`, `efficiency`, `weight` attributes and the `ignite()` method. We may have some code in the `Car`'s `turn_on()` method that calls the `Engine`'s `ignite()` method. Note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "![composition](fig/composition.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `Car`'s `accelerate()` method has access to the `Engine`'s `efficiency` attribute, because the `Car` object keeps track of the `engine` attribute which contains an `efficiency` attribute.\n",
    "2. The `ignite()` method does not have access to the `brand` attribute, as the `Engine` class is \"blind\" to where it is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python a class can be a *component* of a *composite* class. In the example above, `Engine` is a *component* of the *composite* class `Car`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an empty class with no attributes and no methods. The `pass` keyword in general allows creating classes and functions that do nothing (can be used as a placeholder). If we use `dir()` on this class, we see a lot of \"dunder\" methods."

    "\n",
    "The standard method of creating diagrams to represent the relationships among classes is the Unified Modeling Language, or **UML**. It is often used to show class hierarchies. By planning a project before we start coding, we can make better design choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "UML can contain + and - signs to denote *public* and *private* accessibility. Python does not formally support formal access modifiers, and everything is public. For our purposes, we are just going to mark every member of every class as \"public\" with a + sign. You may also see a data type following a colon, which describes the type of the attribute. A type following a method name indicates the return type of the method.\n",

    "Arrows express inheritance. The arrow goes from the *child* class to (i.e., points to) the *parent* class.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UML - inheritance](fig/uml_inheritance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can similarly express composition. For that we draw a solid diamond arrow from the *composite* class to the *component* class. We can add a number to show the number of component instances contained in the composite class. If instead of a number we have a `*` symbol, this means that the composite class can contain a variable number of component instances. A **range** indicates that the composite class can contain a certain range of instances. For example:\n",

    "An interface is a description of the attributes and behaviors an object has. This consists of\n",
    "\n",
    "* The set of attributes and methods that make up classes.\n",
    "* Not the implementation of the method, just the declaration.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interface, therefore, is a list of declarations, but not of definitions. It is like saying \"all mammals can move\", without specifying how they move. Some languages, such as C# or Java, have an actual mechanism called an interface which lists these class members, but Python does not, partly because, unlike most languages, Python supports multiple inheritance. We will focus on the concept of interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interfaces example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the interface, *not* shown in the diagram below, but let's pretend that it implements two methods: `quack()` and `waddle()`. In other words, some part of our program needs an object that conforms to this interface. Three of the four classes in the diagram below conform to this interface.\n",

Anywhere the program expects a `Duck`, we can pass an `AttackDuck`, because it has the same attributes and methods. We saw this in our exception example, when we inherited from `Exception`, which in turn inherits from `BaseException`, we inherited the interface of `Exception`.\n",

A `CommissionEmployee` is also a `SalaryEmployee`, so, when it calculates its payroll, it should do it the same way as the parent class. Let's do something a bit unintuitive: we create a variable `fixed` that stores the result of `super().calculate_payroll()`. This seems useless, as the parent `calculate_payroll()` method just returns the `.weekly_salary` attribute, so we could just access it directly. If, however, we change the way we calculate the salary for the `SalaryEmployee` class, this would change the implementation of the `calculate_payroll()` method in the same class.

    "## Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example above, we never instantiated the `Employee` class. It was created only to define the `.id` and `.name` attributes. We could create an instance of this class and try to pass it through the `PayrollSystem`, but this will fail because it does not have a `calculate_payroll()` method. In other words, the `Employee` class does *not* conform to the `IPayrollCalculator` interface defined above. This is not really a problem. The `Employee` class was not created to be instantiated, but just to be inherited from. It is an *abstract class*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard Library has an `abc` module for abstract classes. We are going to modify the definition of our `Employee` class making it inherit from `abc.ABC`. We will also create a `calculate_payroll()` method so that the class now conforms to the interface. The method does nothing, and note that it has an `@abstractmethod` decorator. By using this decorator we are telling Python that this is an abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Employee(ABC):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, id, name):\n",

    "If we now include this modified version of the `Employee` class in the `PayrollSystem` we get a different error: `TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Employee with abstract methods calculate_payroll`. This tells other developers two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They cannot instantiate the `Employee` class directly.\n",
    "2. The `Employee` class can only be inherited from.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class inherits from an abstract class, it should either implement its own version of the methods defined in the abstract class or it should become an abstract class itself. `Employee` does now conform to the interface, but it does not actually implement the `calculate_payroll()` method, instead it lets its children implement them.\n",

    "## Implementing the Productivity System\n",
    "\n",
    "This program should also be able to track employees productivity. We introduce another system: the `ProductivitySystem` that calculates productivity based on employee roles. We consider four roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Managers: they earn a salary.\n",
    "2. Secretary: they earn a salary.\n",
    "3. Sales people: they have a salary and a commission.\n",
    "4. Factory workers: they are paid by the hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, the employees classes are moved to a new file called `employees.py`, while the `PayrollSystem` is still in the `hr.py` file. We add the four new classes to the `employees.py` file. We don't redefine `__init__()` which means that we will be implicitly using the one from `SalaryEmployee`. When we instantiate from this class, we will need to pass an `id`, a `name` and a `weekly_salary`. Instead we will implement a `work()` method that indicates the number of hours the manager has worked for. We can access `self.name` because we have inherited from the parent class. We proceed similarly for the other classes."

Each class has its own linearization, and this process is recursive. The linearization of the `object` class is just itself. In this case we will assume, for simplicity, that the base class is `Employee`, rather than `object`. Expressed as an operator the linearization of class C is L(C).
